# Projects
These are projects that I have done based on tutorials found online to help practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Project 1: ToDo List
    - original tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I&ab_channel=GreatStack 
    - the code for this project was all used from that tutorial, with the graphics and colours being original, and pictures sources online.

Project 2: Maze Game
    - the code was designed with a lot of help from online resources such as google, and stack overflow.
    - not the most efficient, making the code better and more of a maze rather than path will come later.
