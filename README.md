# Projects
These are projects that I have done based on tutorials found online to help practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Project 1: ToDo List
    - original tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I&ab_channel=GreatStack 
    - the code for this project was all used from that tutorial, with the graphics and colours being original, and pictures sources online.
